# Bloom Filter
Class project on [Bloom Filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter). Bloom filters are data structures that represent sets and allow the user to query whether a given item is a member of the set or not. They use hash functions and a clever storage mechanism to represent sets using very little memory. The cost of this is the occasional false positive - a Bloom filter may report that an item is in the set when it is not.
